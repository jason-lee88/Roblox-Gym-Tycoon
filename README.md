## Overview

**Roblox Gym Tycoon** is my first ever fully-completed project finished in May 2017. It is a game where users enter with an empty property and must build their gym from the bottom-up by interacting with blocks in their environment and increase their income.

Players can compete in minigames to get a small cash boost and acquire points (Strength) in order to show other players how experienced they are with these minigames. A leaderboard within the world displays the top players with the most Strength in order to increase competition between players.

The game offers buyable "VIP" products through Roblox's virtual currency "Robux" that can enhance one's gameplay within the game. Examples include run feature, anti-gravity balloon, gym color customization, cash boosts, and more.

## Game Link

You can play the game and explore the environment [here.](https://www.roblox.com/games/184053049)

## Project Details

Roblox games are built under a simplified object-oriented implementation of the scripting language Lua. Users can create 3D games and worlds using Roblox's development environment "Roblox Studio".

## Project Highlights

* My first full completed project
* Exposure to object-oriented programming using pre-defined classes
* Utilized many software-related principles on an intro-level such as classes, objects, properties, hierarchy, control flow, command line, functions, events, server-sided & client-sided interactions, data persistence across sessions through data stores, graphical user interfaces, Http services, and more

## Documentation
Documentation containing Roblox's pre-defined classes, objects, functions, events, and other features can be found [here.](https://developer.roblox.com)

## Notes
* This project is very outdated (last updated May 2017). It is extremely likely that game engine updates over time by Roblox have bugged many features of the game. Please expect game features to be faulty/nonfunctional.
* This project was exported from the Roblox development environment using [Rojo](https://rojo.space/), a tool that allows users to export/import games to/from the Roblox development environment and an external application. The tool's focus is to ensure game scripts are properly transported, so all other objects of a different class than a script have been removed from the Github upload of this project (everything located in "/src"). If you would like to view the full project containing everything else, the original game file "/roblox-gym-tycoon.rbxlx" can be downloaded and opened (NOTE: Roblox Studio must be installed to open and view).
